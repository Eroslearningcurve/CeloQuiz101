# SPEED QUIZ DApp

Simple application that allows users create and partake in speed quizzes. To access a quiz, the user will use the quiz ID, which makes the quiz somewhat permissioned as only those with the quiz ID can partake in that quiz (...PRIVACY... LOL). To create a quiz an add fee of 2 celo is collected and to partake in the quiz a fee of 1 celo and the reward is 2 celo (2 times the start fee). Rewards are given to fast quizzers, with the aid of a benchmark and for a twist for every wrong answer the user picks he loses 10 seconds.
